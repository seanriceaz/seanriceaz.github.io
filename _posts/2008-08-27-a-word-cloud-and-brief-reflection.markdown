This is what my site looks like in the form of a word cloud (make your own at <a href="http://www.wordle.net">wordle.net</a>).  I suppose I look like a Microsoft junkie at the moment... Let me assure you that this is not the case. I'm a firm believer in the right tool for the right job.

That said, most of my time is spent in Photoshop and Illustrator as of late. I'm almost beginning to feel like a traditional graphic designer again. I've got some pretty nifty stuff coming up for U-Haul, and it isn't even <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/supergraphics">SuperGraphics</a> related! I've also been working on a promo piece—for print even—for a web application shop out in Mesa.  I've been busy!  I love it all!

Good things coming up... Stay tuned!
