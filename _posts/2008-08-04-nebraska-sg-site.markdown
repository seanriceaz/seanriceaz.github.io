  content: "[...] of today, I&#8217;ve got two sites that use Silverlight for animation
    live. I think that&#8217;s two more than most other web [...]"

Probably the most notable part of this site is that it uses <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a> to do the animation. I learned a great deal about Silverlight, C# (C-Sharp).

If the still images aren't enough for you (and I don't expect that they are), <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/supergraphics/landing.aspx?site_id=85&amp;sort_order=0" target="_blank">go to the live site</a>.

One of my favorite things about this site is how the animation transitions smoothly between scenes. That's something made much easier by Silverlight.  Simply set end points for all your shapes, colors, gradients, storyboarded canvases (think of these like movie clips), and vertices and that's all there is to it.  Awesome.

There are a few places where you may notice a lack of animation during the scene.  I had planned to add some stuff to these, but for the sake of actually finishing the project on time, I had to trim them down to bare bones.  All in all, I think everyone involved was pretty happy with this one.

Special thanks to Pawel for all the help getting this thing coded in .NET and pushed live.
