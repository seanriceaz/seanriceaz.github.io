I designed this product packaging and poster as student work at NAU. The idea was to create something that might be possible in 50 years. So, I thought to myself, "what will be retro in the future.... Apple!" And so this looks a bit like the ads for the first generation iPod Nano. I also designed the branding for Ubiquitek, my fictional company.
