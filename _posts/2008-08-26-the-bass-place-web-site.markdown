I recently approached <a href="http://www.thebassplace.com">The Bass Place</a> in Tempe, about doing their web site.  Being a bass player myself and a somewhat regular customer of The Bass Place, I thought it good to approach them about redesigning their site. The Bass Place's online store has been around for quite a few years, and was much in need of a facelift.

One of the main challenges I had with designing this site is that it needed to use their current shopping cart software. They were used to this software and it had their inventory in it already, so this was a timesaver on their end.

Thankfully, the software uses an HTML template that I was able to mold into a standards-based, css-driven site.  I even got to use a bit of jQuery!

All in all, I consider it a great success.  Dennis and the other people at the Bass place are a pleasure to work with.

Props to my friend and colleague Mike Jones for creating the bass, amps, and accessories icons for me.
