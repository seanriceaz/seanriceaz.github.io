I wanted to create a way to engage future employers who would receive my resume. To accomplish this, I came up with an origami booklet. The pages all either feature "snapshots" of my portfolio, or some other playful designs.

The recipient of this booklet could also tear out the perforated pages and fold them into origami (instructions included).
