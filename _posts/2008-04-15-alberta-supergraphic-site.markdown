This graphic was all about the invention and construction of a ship made of ice. Apparently, top secret plans for this moving iceberg were created to combat the U-Boat problem during World War 2.

The concept for the site was digging through top secret documents.

The live site is available <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/SuperGraphics/169/Venture-Across-America-and-Canada-Modern/Alberta">here</a>.
