This project was more of an experiment for all involved. Bethany Bible Church wanted to try using video to promote their programs, and I was tapped to produce it. I was primarily in charge of editing the video, though I did film part of it (the driving sequences and Light Rail stuff).

For this, I wanted to try out Windows Movie Maker to see if I could get by with a non-professional editing suite. The only part I found totally lacking about Movie Maker was its title wizards. Mostly, what I needed was a way to outline the text so it could be more readable. Alas, I had to make do with what meager provisions it had.

This is my first foray into editing a full video piece. I learned a lot. And next time I'll try some different software.
