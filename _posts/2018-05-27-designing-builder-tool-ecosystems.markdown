excerpt: I design tool sets that need to interact with each other within the context of a larger ecosystem of apps. Here's a framework for describing the different levels involved.

As a user journeys through our family of applications at Infusionsoft, they traverse many levels of functionality that they are probably unaware of as they move. In order to design a cohesive experience, we designers need to visualize the different layers of our app and plan for ways to help our users transition between them seamlessly.

That starts with knowing and mapping your layers. From there, you can more easily understand and communicate about the features that exist at each layer and how a user can move between different layers to access those features.

## Defining the layers

When I started at Infusionsoft in 2017, they already had a fairly mature set of functionality. The web app was powerful, but complex with lots of interdependent parts. One of the reasons for comparatively poor engagement at the time was that our more novice users had difficulty finding the key features they would need to become successful. Simple, general-purpose features like email sending were made more complicated because design and automation features were combined into the same tool. Other pieces of functionality that should have been standalone couldn't be accessed at all outside the confines of an automated workflow (called a *campaign*);

We needed to clarify what the layers were in our application.

For Infusionsoft, here's what our layers look like:

- Design system
- App
- Meta builders
- Builders
- Content editors
