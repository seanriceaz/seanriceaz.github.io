The gift of a designer isn't merely the ability to make or change things. It's _seeing_ what needs to be made or changed.

Seeing is easy right? As a designer, I see numerous problems to solve every day. When I encounter a problem that causes enough of a "rub", I know it's time to get hacking.

This article is about why I hacked a better spell checker into Sketch, an app I use every day.

## Feeling the rub


## The hack


## But, I'm a designer!


## I'm a hacker, and so can you

Don't settle for almost good enough. When you encounter a problem, make a solution, even if it's a bit rough at first, or you don't really know what you're doing. When you find something that works, share it so the world can benefit, then continuously improve it. That's hacking.

There are a lot of problems out there in the world. As a designer, you see what other people don't see. Whether you get people to help you, or solve the problems yourself, the people living on this planet deserve solutions to their problems. This planet deserves to be hacked.

So, in the words of ZeroCool...
