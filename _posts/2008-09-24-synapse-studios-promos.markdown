A small web consultancy based in the Phoenix area, <a href="http://www.synapsestudios.com">Synapse Studios</a>, contacted me needing some promo items. Specifically, they wanted 2 pages front/back that could tell people at trade shows and meetings who they are and what they do.

Most importantly, they wanted to stand out from everyone else.

So, I designed 4 pages, each with a different theme. The idea was to showcase their creative capabilities while making the flyers easy and enjoyable to read.

Mission accomplished.
