Error handling is the last in the list of [My 10 Heuristics](/heuristics/user-experience/2016/10/07/heuristics-overview.html). It's also usually the last thing to get designed, many times as an afterthought to the rest of the design. This should not be! Error is so much a part of the Human Experience and so much a part of our experiences with software, that we should plan a significant occurrence of error in our software.

## Error states

### Input incorrect

This error state occurs often around login screens. A user mistypes their username or password and the system has to alert them to their mistake. Usually this notification involves highlighting the offending field with a message like &quot;The username or password you entered is invalid.&quot; Incorrect input also happens when the user leaves fields blank or enters an invalid credit card number.

Savvy designers have made this experience more human using a shake animation instead of just adding error text. Something like this may not be appropriate for all situations, but it adds an element of fun to lessen the impact of the mistake.

### Input out of acceptable range

### Input type mismatch

### Accidental click

### Connection interruption

## Error Prevention

Jokob Nielsen states in his article [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), &quot;Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.&quot; Well-designed and well-executed user experiences prevent the user from making errors in several different ways.

### Correct mistakes for the user

### Limit inputs to acceptable values

### Enable easy recovery from error states

### Avoid imprecise input methods
