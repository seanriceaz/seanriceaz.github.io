The aesthetic quality of a web site or app is pretty subjective. Yet, I use aesthetics as a key heuristic when evaluating these experiences. In Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), he lists a heuristic for &quot;Aesthetic and minimalist design.&quot; He defines this like so:

> &quot;Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.&quot;



## What I look for

### Noise

### Alignment

### Color harmony

### Image selection





## Stay tuned!

Next week, I'll post a detailed look at Heuristic #3: Awareness from [My 10 Heuristics](http://seanrice.net/heuristics/user-experience/2016/10/07/heuristics-overview.html)
