The aesthetic quality of a web site or app is pretty subjective. Yet, I use aesthetics as a key heuristic when evaluating these experiences. In Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), he lists a heuristic for &quot;Aesthetic and minimalist design.&quot; He defines this like so:

> &quot;Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.&quot;

## What I look for

When auditing the usability of a web site or app, my focus on aesthetics pertains to how the look and feel of a site affects its usability. Generally speaking, elements on the screen should look like what they are, and the graphical choices should not impede usability.

### Noise

Noise is the _anti-minimalism_. Digital experiences that are meant to be usable should have very little noise. Noise can take many forms. Generally, interruptive elements, overuse of content-heavy images, and backgrounds that interfere with readability of text on top of them are noisy and should be avoided.

### Alignment

Elements should be aligned well. Text should generally align (left/right/or center) with other text on the screen. Usage of a grid system can help with this, though proper implementation of it is critical to elements aligning properly.

Improper alignment makes the design look accidental and unprofessional. This is very distracting to the user.

### Color harmony

In a usable experience, colors don't call attention to themselves. There is a lot of science around color theory and perception that we won't cover here in terms of color harmony, but here are a few guidelines:

- Colors that vibrate (like complimentary colors) should not be placed next to each other
- Background and foreground colors should be different enough to make the foreground stand out
- Brand colors should be accurately reproduced in digital elements and should match.

### Image selection
