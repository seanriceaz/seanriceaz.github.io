You shouldn't use parts of a design system you don't understand. That's not pretense. Overly complex systems will slow you down, hinder your product, and ultimately be abandoned.

## An analogous system: The Tokyo Metro

It's been a long time, but I've been to Tokyo twice. It has one of the best and most efficient rail systems in the world.

As a foreigner, it was very confusing the first time I rode it.

### The Gist

The first thing you do is buy a ticket from a kiosk. Unless you want an extra headache, you need to buy a ticket with _exactly_ as much money on it as you need to ride that day, or at least that trip. Prices for each stop are listed above the kiosks, _usually_ with readable english labels alongside the Japanese ones.

After that, you walk to the stiles, put your ticket in and walk through, retrieving your ticket from the other side. Then, you must find your train, board, and ride to your destination.

Lastly, you get off, walk to the stiles, and insert your ticket to exit.

### Why is this analogous?

Each step of this process was new to me the first time I did it. It took a long time. On my first ride on my own, I took the wrong train and got lost. But I got help, and after a few more newbie errors, was able to use the train daily during my trips.

This system somewhat complex, but it's learnable. Even children can do it (and often do) on their own.

The _value_ I got from the system was immense. It was inexpensive, efficient, and convenient. It got me where I needed to go quickly and easily.

### Well-Designed Systems Get Used

A system isn't valuable because of its complexity. It's valuable _in spite of_ it. If I had failed to figure out how to use the Tokyo Metro, I would have found another, more expensive, way to travel. I would have used a taxi. The designers of that rail system knew they needed a system every person could use. They built it so that dumb foreigners like me could even figure it out with a little help.

## Another Analogous System: Amateur Radio

I'm an amateur radio operator. Very amateur. I have a license to broadcast on certain frequencies with a special radio so I can talk to others like me. I had to study for an exam to prove I knew how to operate the equipment legally and safely. That means I needed to know a lot about how radio waves are made and received. I was tested on the laws, protocols, and etiquette for amateur radio, as well as some specialized jargon.

My equipment is pretty basic. It's a cheap handheld radio that can reach about 20 miles at relatively low power. I had to program my radio with special software and cables. I have to understand how to use my radio to connect to the radio towers that can re-broadcast my signal with much greater range. And then I need the guts to push the transmit button.

Other operators build expensive towers to hook up to their expensive custom radio rigs just so they can send and receive morse code across the country.

I have often heard amateur radio operators lament that the hobby is dying out. Not many people are picking it up anymore. After all, it's easier to just pick of a cell phone and send a text.

### Difficult-to-use Systems Get Relegated to Hobbyists

Amateur Radio Operators like me enjoy learning how the technology works. We solder circuit boards and program things. We could use radio to control drones, transmit pictures, or even send email. But the barrier to entry on all this is extremely high with radio. You have to want to learn how to do it the hard way. Especially when your cell phone is sitting right there with all those features just a tap away.

## Designing for Other Designers

Your design system is complex. It manages accessibility, theming, input, spacing, typography, color, and more. You know its ins and outs. You know the gotchas and the killer features. You can probably build amazing experiences with it.

But you're not the one tasked with building those experiences, are you? 

If you're like me, it's other designers that are building all those great experiences. And you're probably frustrated when they don't use the system like you had intended. They work around carefully planned component and token interconnections. They ignore carefully written guidelines. They only watch the first minute of your how-to videos.

If you're seeing these behaviors, your design system isn't providing enough value for other designers to overcome the learning curve. You built a design system for other design systems nerds like you, and not for the day to day product designers that are actually using it.

## Coming to Terms

How do you make designers use the system you built?

You don't. You can't make a product team work slower to accomodate your system.

You shouldn't try.

Instead, empathize with the designers. Engage them in the process of improving the design system you all use. Instead of relying on training, make the system easier to adopt. Look for components and systems that are difficult and explore alternative solutions with the other teams.

... In other words, treat your design system as a product. Do some User Experience Design and Product Management on the system itself.

## Hard Truth

Designers and product teams always have a choice. They can use your system, or choose not to. The reality is that if your system is too difficult to adopt, it's slowing teams down. Systems that slow teams down won't be supported by the organization for long.

If you're a designer trying to adopt something that isn't making thigns easier for you or your users, don't.

... But maybe don't roll custom yet. Reach out to your design system team. You can improve the system together. 

Design sytems are a team sport, and every team member matters.
