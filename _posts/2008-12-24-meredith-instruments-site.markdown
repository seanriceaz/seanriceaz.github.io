For this site, I was contracted by the same folks who own <a href="http://www.thebassplace.com">The Bass Place</a>, <a href="http://www.seanrice.net/190/the-bass-place-web-site/">whom I've done design for in the past</a>. They essentially wanted a site that uses a very similar template/style to The Bass Place's site since I've already done something they liked, and works using their shopping cart software.

So, this was a much quicker design job, since I already had it basically built already. I just changed some colors and images, and then launched it!

Special thanks to Mike Jones, who created the laser icons for me.

The live site is <a href="http://www.mi-lasers.com">available here</a>.
