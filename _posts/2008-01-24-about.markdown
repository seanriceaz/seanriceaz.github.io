<h2>UX Design</h2>
I currently serve as a product designer at 29th Drive. I cut my teeth in user experience as the lead UX Designer on the U-Haul Web Team, where I was employed for 6 years starting in 2007. I really enjoy taking complex processes like planning reservations or managing logistics and making them simpler for the customers and employees that need to interact with them. In the end, these optimizations provide a better experience for the customer, and allow the employee to be more effective at their jobâ€”hopefully even enjoying it a little more.
<h2>Visual Design</h2>
I was trained formally in Graphic Design at Northern Arizona University, where I received my Bachelor's of Fine Arts in 2006. I took that education and converted it to experience with print and web design at the NAU Marketing Department before departing for U-Haul. I still use the graphic design skills I gained there to coax the highest-quality design deliverables from myself and my team.
<h2>Frontend Development</h2>
While my formal education only scratched the surface of interactive media, by gaining experience on-the-job since 2005, I became rather adept at developing web sites in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and even Flash and Silverlight. I have written a few WordPress themes, and modified several more to meet freelance client and employer needs. I've been creating interactive web sites since IE6, so I know my way around a text editor.
<h2>Summary</h2>
I am a well-rounded designer with a focus on UX, usability, and interaction design. I have several years of experience leading design teams and clients to produce the highest quality and best performing experiences for users-both external and internal.

This site serves as a showcase more for my visual design experience than UX primarily because many of the applications I work on are protected, not-to-mention generally less focused on eye-catching graphics than high performance.
