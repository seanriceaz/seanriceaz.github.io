I was subcontracting for Synapse Studios for this project. The client wanted a web site for their business with a blog. Naturally, this new site was built on <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.

So, I designed a wordpress template for them that would suit the needs of their business.

To my knowledge, this site is no longer available on the internet.
