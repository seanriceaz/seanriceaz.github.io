## Title

Discuss why adding special features for differently-abled devices is like having different ways to traverse floors in a hospital.

As opposed to removing staircases because some people can't climb them due to a physical disability.

Stairs only?
Ramps only?
Elevators only?
Etc.

Ultimately, this is about responsive design.
