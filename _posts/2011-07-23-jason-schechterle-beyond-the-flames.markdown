Jason Schechterle was launching a new nonprofit and he needed a logo design and brand identity that matched his incredible story and drive to help others. As part of this project I designed a logo and a web site for him and his foundation, Beyond the Flames.

The web site is online at <a href="http://www.beyondtheflames.com">beyondtheflames.com</a>
