As of today, I've got <a title="New Brunswick SuperGraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/179/new-brunswick-sg-site/">two</a> <a title="Nebraska SuperGraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/163/nebraska-sg-site/">sites</a> that use <a href="http://microsoft.com/silverlight" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> for animation live. I think that's two more than most other web designers have. These recent launches have me thinking that I really like my job. I don't think most web designers have the opportunity to design web sites about <a title="Nebraska SuperGraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/163/nebraska-sg-site/">dinosaurs</a>, <a title="New Brunswick SuperGraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/179/new-brunswick-sg-site/">rising tides</a>, <a title="Alberta Supergraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/122/alberta-supergraphic-site/">secret WWII ice ships</a>, and <a title="Maine SuperGraphic Site" href="http://www.seanrice.net/12/maine-supergraphic-site/">the Ice Age</a>. Of course, I also get to design a few things that don't have such a high coolness factor, but it's all part of the job.

That's right other designers, be jealous.
