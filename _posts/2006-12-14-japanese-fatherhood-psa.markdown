I was inspired to create this poster when I learned about some of the social issues surrounding fatherhood in Japan. The text reads, "Don't you think you should take a day off of work and spend it with your children?" Men in Japan typically work all day and spend their leisure hours with coworkers, leaving their wives at home to take care of the kids. Often, fathers even live in different cities than their families.

While it seems this social problem is not localized only to Japan, cross-cultural design presents some unique challenges, and I wanted to explore that.

I found the Japanese language and characters (Kanji) particularly fun to design with. The colors and simple illustrative style are also inspired by contemporary Japanese designs.
