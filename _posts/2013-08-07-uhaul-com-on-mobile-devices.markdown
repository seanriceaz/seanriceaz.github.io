Starting in late 2011 and into 2012, <a href="http://uhaul.com" target="_blank">uhaul.com</a> got a mobile conversion. This version of the site shares most of the underlying markup with the desktop version, and is accessed from the same URLs. As of this writing, it is currently live, so feel free to check it side-by-side on multiple devices.
