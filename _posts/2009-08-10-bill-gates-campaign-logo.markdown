I was contracted to create a logo for Bill Gates, a candidate for Phoenix City Council (District 3).

I needed to make sure it would be readable from a distance, so it could be placed on campaign signs throughout Phoenix. He also wanted more traditional colors.

So, I created a logo for him using the traditional Red, White and Blue with a nice sans-serif font (Univers). The logo also incorporates the sunburst from the Arizona State Flag.
