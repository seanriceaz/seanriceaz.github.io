The City of Flagstaff Environmental Services Division needed a visual identity that encompassed the entire organization and some of their ideals, most notably, sustainability.

I presented them with this mark. The trees evoke recycling and sustainability. This really impressed the folks at the Environmental Services Division.

They are currently beginning to use this mark for all of their new brochures, mailings, signage, etc.

I also created a business system to showcase different ways to use the mark.
