This was a web page I designed for Campus Crusade for Christ at NAU. It uses WordPress as a CMS, so they could edit it even after I graduated.  This was also part of my senior capstone project at NAU. All artowrk and icons were created by me, with the exception of the background pattern, which I took from SquidFingers, though I changed the colors significantly.
