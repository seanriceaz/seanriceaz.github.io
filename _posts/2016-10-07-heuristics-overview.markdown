## Didn't Jakob Nielsen already make this?

The short answer is *yes*. In fact, these heuristics are based on his original essay from 1995, [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). I had some difficulty applying the heuristics in his article in client-facing UX reviews (at [Ethology](http://www.ethology.com), we call them _Heuristic Reviews_). The issue was that Nielsen's heuristics sound very academic, and are difficult for people new to practicing user experience to understand. They are also very universal in scope &mdash; they apply equally well to soda machines, airplane cockpits, and mobile apps.

What I needed was something simpler and easier to clearly apply to the user interfaces of mobile apps and web sites. I developed the following heuristics to meet that need.

## My 10 heuristics

1. [Accessibility](/heuristics/user-experience/2016/10/16/heuristic-1-accessibility.html)
2. [Aesthetics](/heuristics/user-experience/2016/10/21/heuristic-2-aesthetics.html)
3. Awareness
4. Wayfinding
5. Reactivity
6. Legibility
7. Affordance
8. Simplicity
9. Clarity
10. Error handling

## What next?

I will be creating a series of blog posts addressing each of these heuristics, what they mean, and how to apply them in your designs. Basically, I'm going to expand on this article I published last month: [Is your digital experience frictionless?](http://www.ethology.com/blog/digital-experience-frictionless/)

## Some notes

It bears mentioning that these were conceived and developed during my time at 29th Drive, which was acquired by [Tallwave](https://www.tallwave.com) and [Ethology](http://www.ethlogy.com) to become the design departments of both organizations. These heuristics are still in use by both companies at the time of publishing.
