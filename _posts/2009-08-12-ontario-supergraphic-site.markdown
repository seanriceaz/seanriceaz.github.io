The <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/SuperGraphics/175/Venture-Across-America-and-Canada-Modern/Ontario">Ontario SuperGraphic</a> is all about people escaping slavery in the South U.S. (before the Civil War) by heading toward the North. Often, they ended up in Canada.

I used some elements, including the period-accurate lantern and the map from the actual graphic itself, as well as a weathered paper and arrow motif to tie it all together. Look for the Indiana Jones-esque moving arrows when you change pages!

I wanted to bring elements of the time period and the escape adventure into the site, so I did that using a simulated snapshot of the sky from that time (and facing Northâ€”can you find the North Star?). Also, the typography is similar to what appeared on signs, leaflets and posters back then.
