<h3>The design</h3>
This is a site I created for <a href="http://www.mi-lasers.com">Meredith Instruments</a>, a lab laser and laser parts retailer.
The design was to be high-tech, but not flashy. Their logo has a strong horizontal red stripe in it, and I decided to use that as a starting point for this. To add a little modern flare without being "flashy" I used a subtle gradient in the background of the content area.
<h3>Under the hood</h3>
For the backend, I decided to use Zen Cart, since it has a very active support community, is open source, and it already supports Meredith Instruments' payment gateway. It also has several helpful plugins and community-supported modifications that helped me get it to work the way I envisioned.
