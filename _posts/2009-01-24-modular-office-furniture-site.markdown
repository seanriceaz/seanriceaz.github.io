The client for this wanted a site to showcase their extensive supply of office furniture and get potential customers in contact with them.

I worked through <a href="http://www.synapsestudios.com" target="_blank">Synapse Studios</a> to design the site for this client.

The trick for this site was to balance a lot of copy against a bunch of images. Usually, it's difficult to get one or the other from a client, and in this case they really came through on both.

This is a custom <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> template that makes use of the <a href="http://www.instinct.co.nz/e-commerce/" target="_blank">wp-ecommerce</a> plugin for the inventory list.

Unfortunately, this site is not online as of this posting.

Here is the <a href="http://www.modofficeaz.com/" target="_blank">client's current site</a>.
