  content: I would suggest a better RSS link presence on your main site navigation.  Most
    sites have it around the main navigation or on the right side of their page which
    is where I was looking for it.  And they usually have a nice logo or bigger link,
    etc.  I definitely was not looking for it at the bottom in tiny 8 pt.  sorry.  :)  Just
    my 2 cents on this - you don't have to do nothin' if you don't feel like it!  Other
    than that the site looks pretty good!  keep it up!

Okay, so I'm just getting used to this whole "blogosphere" thing myself. I've set up blogs before, but now I'm more interested in driving traffic to <a href="http://www.seanrice.net">my site</a> so people can see my portfolio, etc.  The good news is that <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> makes this pretty easy for you. My RSS feed was set up from the get-go. Awesome. I've now got it running through <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a> so I can track all my subscribers. I've even linked it to my <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> page! I'm so Web 2.0 now!

So, I'm just getting started with trying to drive traffic to my site, since it's (mostly) looking good and working. I'm finding that I'll need to write a bunch of comments on people's blogs, link to 'em in my links, try to get my site published on CSS galleries and all sorts of fun stuff. I'm sort of getting excited just thinking about it!
