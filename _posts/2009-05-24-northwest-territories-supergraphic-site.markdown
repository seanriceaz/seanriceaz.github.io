The concept for this site was to portray the environment that the truckers are driving through during winter in the Northwest Territories.

So, I decided to emphasize the aurora borealis and the fact that the truckers are literally driving across a frozen lake. There are some simple motion graphics to go with this site--Three different trucks travel across the screen, leaving a trail of snow and cracks in the ice underneath them.

The live site is <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/SuperGraphics/171/Venture-Across-America-and-Canada-Modern/Northwest-Territories" target="_blank">here</a>.
