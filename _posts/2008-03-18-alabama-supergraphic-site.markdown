This site was created for <a href="http://www.uhaul.com">U-Haul</a> as part of their <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/supergraphics">SuperGraphics</a> program. I was responsible for the entire web page design. This site's goal is to educate people about and highlight a unique area of Alabama, where several new species of plants are being discovered.

The live site is located <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/SuperGraphics/27/Venture-Across-America-and-Canada-Modern/Alabama">here</a>.
