How do users interact with a digital experience? And how does the experience respond to the input? Generally, the library of interactions a user can do are click, tap, drag, swipe, pinch, scroll or hover. There are many others, but these form the most widely used ones.

Interactivity as a heuristic is about informing the user about available interactions, and then responding appropriately to them.

## Informing the user

There are many ways to inform the user about how to interact with your experience. You can give them clues to click by making something look like a button, which really only requires surrounding text with a colored box and little else. You can tell users to click and drag using an area that looks grippy. Users know to swipe when something peeks out from the sides of the screen, or is accompanied by slideshow progress dots. You can also inform users with help text on the screen.

### When an interactive element doesn't look interactive

The most common example of this is links that look like plain text, or buttons that have a white, gray, or black background with white, gray or black text. In these cases, it's all about context. Make sure the button has plenty of space around it so that it stands out as something interactive. Also, make sure the button doesn't look _disabled_.

The only way to know for sure if your interactive elements appear interactive enough is to user test them, especially if your experience is pushing the limits of usability to meet a certain aesthetic.

### When an element looks interactive, but isn't

The issue that usually comes up when reviewing for this is when items that look interactive are, in fact not interactive at all. It's _very easy_ to run into this problem because users will click on just about anything that stands out. Here's a short list:

- Any image
- Headline text
- Anything with a border
- Anything with an underline
- Anything with a drop shadow
- Icons
-

## Responding appropriately

This is tricky.

## Stay tuned!
