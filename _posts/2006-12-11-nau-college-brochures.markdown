While working at the Northern Arizona University Marketing Department, I was involved in several projects. One of the more notable projects was one where I helped to create a series of brochures for the different colleges at NAU.

I created layouts for all of the individual colleges and a few special programs. There are nine in all, but I have selected five to show here. These brochures are currently being sent out to thousands of prospective students.
