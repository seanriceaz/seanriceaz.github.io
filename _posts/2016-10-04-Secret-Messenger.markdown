## The problem

Have you ever been on a plane, or at church, or in a car seated next to somebody who appears a little interested in your text messages? Maybe you want to write a message about this person to somebody else, but you can't because they might see it, and so instead of connecting with somebody, you remain silent.

## Proposed solution

Why not place the phone keyboard at the top of the screen? This way, users can type messages while covering the screen with their palms.

## Anticipated UX ramifications

Hiding the message dialog from the view of others also hides it from the user's view. This may result in an increase in typographical errors, which may increase frustration.

## Prototyping

I will broadcast a live sketching session around this idea and post the resulting sketches here. [Follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/SeanRiceaz) for a heads-up on when this will happen.
