		<h2>Art Of Play Magazine </h2>
		<p>This is a mock magazine that I designed for a class project.  My idea was to make a magazine targeted at people interested in designing toys.  No such magazine (to my knowledge) currently exists. </p>
		<p>Realistically, this magazine would probably have such a small readership that it wouldn't make it very far, but I wanted to try something new. </p>
		<p>This magazine showcases some of my publication design skills. It was good to have the freedom to experiment with image and text arrangement through this project. </p>
		<p>All of the content in this magazine, except for some images in the Table of Contents and one image in the article were created or photographed by me.</p>
